☭ Developer Notes:
- This theme was not built — it was collectivized.
- The CSS resets itself, in accordance with the five-year plan.
- Any bugs are counter-revolutionary behavior. Report them to Party HQ.
- We do not cache. We *redistribute* performance.
- All commits are equal, but some are more equal than others.
